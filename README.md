## Note

~~Date 06.01.2019:~~

~~There is an issue in C language. I am unable to set new head and also clear the head previous pointer. Therefore, during reverse display it is going to an infinite loop.~~

~~Newer Update:~~

~~I have fixed the error. But I just tweaked my reverse display so that it can work normally. Feel free to suggest any work around.~~

Fixed:
